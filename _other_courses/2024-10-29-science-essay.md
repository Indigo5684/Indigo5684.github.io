title:  "Is WiFi Getting Worse? Electronamgnetic Pollution, and Why It Matters"

"My cell service just isn't what it was five hears ago."

If this quote rings true, you're not alone. Though our digital infrastructure has been growing faster and faster, so has the amount of people utilizing it, leading to an overall slower network speed. Sometimes, though, the solution isn't to simply buy a faster phone plan. Sometimes, the solution is to get everyone else to just *shut up*.

The internet is not an infinite resource. This sounds counter-intuitive at first - can't you simply buy a faster router? But no, at some point, even the fastest equipment will bottleneck against the internet's **frequency allocation**. At it's most fundamental level, wireless internet is simply a radio communicator. A transmitter and reciever combination (a *transciever*) is located in your phone, laptop, and computer, and its counterpart in your router. And like any other radio, it must be dialed to the proper *frequency* in order to operate.

Intuitively, this frequency would be based on what network you select, with each network operating on a separate frequency to avoid interfering with eachother. Yet this is not the case. All modern WiFi transcievers are pre-dialed to select frequencies (**2.4GHz** and **5GHz**), shared by *all* networks. This means that even if you're on a private WiFi network exclusive to only you, if your neighbor is streaming high-definition video on their internet, yours could be slowed down respectively.

And nowdays, with the exponential increase in wireless devices, from laptops to lightbulbs, we are increasingly utilizing the limited frequency space availible to us.

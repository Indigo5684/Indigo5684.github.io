To Whom It May Concern,

Welcome to my writing portfolio, where mathematics and physics meets English. It is well understood phenomena in academia that when given a relatively large sample consisting of STEM graduates, a vast majority fail to understand the nuance of writing and communication.

It may not be immediately apparent how my portfolio correlates to math and physics. To this, I raise my project proposal. Whether writing grants or presenting to sponsors, I am proud to be able to create persuasive rhetoric that incorporates scientific data, such as survey results, statistics, or monetary figures. This is compounded in my feasibility report, in which I am able to use publicly verifiable figures to justify a position.

At the same time, I recognize that as a mathematician, I fall under a small minority consisting of those who would enjoy more numbers, not less. As a writer, I am able to create works that cater to a specific audience that may not share my values or knowledge. An example of this can be found in my progress report, in which I acknowledged that my audience was an internal event planning committee. As such, they would be reading from a different perspective than, say, an ADA or compliance auditor.

The last work I wish to highlight is the Access Guide document, in which I and others collaborated on to cater to an audience that potentially requires accommodations, while simultaneously creating a document that the general reader may use to navigate the event. In addition to being able to develop materials for the general public and work with a team, the access guide represents the ability to create standardized procedures and instructions. These are skills that would transfer readily to other purposes, such as creating documentation or writing corporate policy.

Linked below are hyperlinks to the various materials described.

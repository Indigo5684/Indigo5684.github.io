This report demonstrates my ability to seek initiative when seeing a problem, as well as my ability to utilize scientific evidence (e.g. statistics) in documents to create a persuasive argument without detracting from the reader's focus or overfilling the document with jargon. While this proposal is aimed towards fire safety and the ability to find alternate housing, I am comfortable with and prepared to seek out potential problems before they occur and undertake or propose preventative measures for the future.

###### Who Am I?
Hiya - I'm a student at the University of Alabama currently majoring in mathematics and minoring in physics.

Aside from that, I occasionally play around with linux system administration, NodeJS, Factorio, HAM Radio, (raspberry) pi(e)s, woodworking, android modding, CNC machining, and 3d printing. Bonus points if you can tell which ones are games and which ones aren't.

##### Personal Values

I place high value on integrity and respect, as well as openness and honesty. I am a supporter of open-source development and patentleft/copyleft works, as well as a supporter of publically accessible resources such as the Amateur Radio band, public libraries, and the Internet Archive. I do not believe that humanity's advancement should be severly gated or stalled by legal barriers except in the case of ethics (ie. artificial intelligence, psychological or neurological exploration, and similar fields).

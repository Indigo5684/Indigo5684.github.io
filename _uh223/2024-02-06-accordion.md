This is my accordion book - my first ever book binding!

There are a few things I learned from this book, in no particular order:

- When cutting paper, invest in a decent paper cutter. A ruler and x-acto knife works, but can dull the blade when shaving bits of metal off the ruler by acccident
- Invest in a few clamps to hold down the ruler, or it will slip and you will waste paper
- When cutting, you need to apply pressure against the ruler or the blade will stray, wasting paper
- Applying a chamfer to the corners is completely unneeded with enough precision - a gentle taper will work just fine
- When doing work in multiple places, being sure to return your tools to your toolkit means nothing if you forget to return your project to your kit as well

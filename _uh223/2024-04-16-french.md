Once more, in no particular order, I learned the following:

- Coincedence and Murphy's Law graced me today, as I had exactly the right amount of paper left to complete a book
- Pink cardstock and lavender thread make a wonderful color combination
- Open holes less with an awl than before and then fully with a needle to result in prettier spines
- Cardstock covers are painful to align properly. Thinner, decorative paper may be worthwile to look into for future bindings
- The ladder pattern looks amazing, and a decent artist could probably extend the pattern onto the covers for the aesthetic appeal
- After all the other books, this felt extremely easy, and I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop
  - Murphy's law, collary: If nothing appears to have gone wrong, you aren't looking in the right place

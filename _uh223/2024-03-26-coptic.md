Once more, in no particular order, I learned the following:

- Books require blood sacrifices.
  - Please dedicate said sacrifices to the blood god.
- Waxing threads does not mean that the thread will remain on the needle.
- When storing a book, just because you don't bend it when putting it inside the storage, does not mean you can bend the storage.
- Paper will do its absolute best to fold ever so slightly askew of where you intend it to fold.
  - Especially if you are folding multiple folios into a section at the same time.
- Tearing paper is a very effective and fast method of making folios.
- Nail polish, no matter the type, will leave marks on folios when folding.
  - Or if you move your hand too much.
  - Or if your hand is anywhere near the paper.

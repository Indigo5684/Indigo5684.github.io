{% include gallery caption="My Books" %}

Once more, in no particular order, I learned the following:

- This book does not require blood sacrifices, thankfully!
- If a single page falls out of a section, be mindful of what direction it's facing when you re-insert it
  - Otherwise, you will pull a _me_ and not realize you have a single folio with the torn edge facing the wrong way
- An x-acto knife that is dull can cut through most papers with enough pressure, and produce a reliable cut
  - If you have experience with x-acto knives on materials that aren't paper, telling when a blade is dull may be difficult
  - Especially if you're in my position, in which every x-acto knive I've used before this has likely had the same blade for years
  - Don't be me and find out when you switch blades when cutting cover board for the first time
- Finding heavy things to apply pressure to something being glued down is diffuclt in a classroom and/or a dorm room
  - Especially if even weight distribution is the goal
  - Textbooks don't count when you use a tablet with e-books, and don't have physical textbooks on-hand anymore
- The cover paper tends to tear very easily, especially near the spine with the diagonal holes
- When a phone reportedly takes a photo properly, be sure to verify, especially if the flash is enabled

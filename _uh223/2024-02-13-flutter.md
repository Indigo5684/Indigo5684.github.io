This is my flutter book - my second ever book binding!

{% include gallery caption="My Flutter Book" %}

Again, in no particular order, I learned the following:

- My x-acto knife will gladly take slivers off of my metal ruler when given the chance
- My professor has a first-aid kit in the building (though it thankfully went unused)
- It is nearly impossible for me to get anything to end up flush without giving myself a 5mm tolerance to each edge
- To cut through paper, use pressure with the knife, or else it won't cut fully
- Adhesive can warp the paper in the most annoying ways
- Going through each step with all the paper at once is great, until you misinterpret a step and all your work is scrapped instead of one or two folios
- Conversely, having to shuffle a pile of tools around is annoying, and re-doing your work may be faster and safer than risking a grab into the toolbag when your x-acto knife's cover may have come loose (though with experience, this becomes less of an issue)

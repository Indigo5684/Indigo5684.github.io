{% include gallery caption="My Books" %}

Again, in no particular order, I learned the following:

- When cutting paper, cut in such a way that if the blade drifts away from the ruler, the cut can be redone without having to scrap the current page
- My nail polish only sometimes will find its way onto the paper
- I should bring a rubber mallet to class, as piercing through eight to ten folios with an awl is not only annoying, but somewhat impossible by hand
- I should invest in a second or third awl to use as alignment pins to ensure the covers don't drift or swivel when I'm expanding holes
- A bandaid or glove would be much appreciated to avoid poking a hole in my finger when pushing a needle through a hole that already has had half a dozen threads passed through it
- Beware of x-acto knives, for they are pointy! Thankfully, no blood sacrifices were given and no demons were summoned.
- Threads getting crossed is subtle and will happen no matter how much attention you pay to avoiding it
- Reflective and/or glossy paper does not work well with this design as it makes the threads difficult to see
- It would probably have been faster and less painful to walk to H.M. Comer and use their laser engraver to burn holes through the book block than it would have been to manually use an awl to poke them out
- No matter how hard I try, each folio and cover will be at least half a millimeter out of tolerance on any given edge, to visibly noticeable results
  - I should invest in a proper paper cutter to fix this

**Subject**: Feasibility Report for Doubling the Amount of Busses

**Purpose**:

I'm writing to request permission to research and write a feasibility report for the proposed project of increasing the number of busses to alleviate traffic. As a mathematics major, I hope that my experience with simulations and mathematical models may be impactful regarding the project and its possible outcome.

**Feasibility Analysis**:

The proposed project seeks to reduce traffic by adding additional bus capacity. This may not prove to be effective, as the current bus system can be argued to be under-utilized, as many busses run far under maximum capacity, meaning that adding additional busses will spread the already-limited bus traffic out over more busses instead of increasing the total bus traffic. Additionally, increasing the number of busses may prove to yield diminishing returns for every additional bus added, meaning that after a certain cutoff, it is no longer economically worthwhile to incrase bus capacity on comparison to alternatives, such as dedicated bus lanes or implementing centrally controlled traffic signals.

**Recommendations**:

Pending approval, I plan to conduct a thourough review of the proposed project as well as alternatives implemented by other universities to identify areas for improvement. Following this, I will write a report detailing the proposal and its alternatives, as well as my analysis thereof, and make a recommendation for which way the university should move foreward (if at all).

If you approve of this request, please email Dr. Fitzsimmons to have me officially assigned to the project, and afterwards, forward me a copy of the proposal as well as any specific guidelines or expectations you may have.

Thank you for considering this request.

**Subject**: Feasibility Report for Adding Design Courses to Architectural Engineering

**Purpose**:

I'm writing to request permission to research and write a feasibility report for the proposed project of adding design courses to the architectual engineering major. As someone who's switched majors and minors, as well as experienced edge-cases in the catalog and advising program, I hope to bring my experience to the project.

**Feasibility Analysis**:

The proposed project seeks to modify the degree program. As such, care must be taken to ensure the university remains in-line with accredidation agencies and the international architectual community while not making sacrificies in the quality of graduates. Because of this, care must be taken to maintain the integrity of the degree program without making major sacrifices to other areas of student study. Additionally, as a small major, the department may face budgetary concerns in regards to staffing and employment, as concern over whether multiple sections of courses will see high enrollment. Lastly, the department may face backlash from other departments, such as the art department, over whether design courses qualify as Fine Arts (FA) courses and thus fill the core graduation requirement for students.

**Recommendations**:

Pending approval, I plan to conduct a thourough review of the proposed project as well as alternatives implemented by other universities to identify areas for improvement. Following this, I will write a report detailing the proposal and its alternatives, as well as my analysis thereof, and make a recommendation for which way the university should move foreward (if at all).

If you approve of this request, please email Dr. Fitzsimmons to have me officially assigned to the project, and afterwards, forward me a copy of the proposal as well as any specific guidelines or expectations you may have.

**Subject**: MEMO: Feasibility Reports for Housing Education

I am writing to you regarding the recent housing education project proposal. Several of my colleagues have expressed interest in writing a feasibility report for the project. Notably, [Name Redacted] wrote as an RA on-campus, giving her a unique insight into the inner workings of the housing department, of which I as student writer can only pretend to write as an insider of. Additionally, she showcased a comprehensive understanding of the project goals and its purpose. It is for these reasons that I would prefer her as an initial member of the project team while the finer details are still being developed.

[Name Redacted] wrote expressing interest in writing a feasibility report as well, with a focus on orientation and communication skills. While these are important skills, the project scope encompasses additional methods to convey information aside from orientation and emphasizes information aside from interpersonal skills. As I believe the feasibility of the project should be assessed across all intended communication methods and how it conveys all relevant information, I would recommend [Last Name] join the project later as our representative to the Bama Bound team, rather than while the project is still being assessed before implementation.

Lastly, [Name Redacted] wrote expressing her belief that the project itself is feasible and that the status quo is indeed flawed, however she offered no research plan for whether the project could meet its intended goals, instead offering a proposed action plan. Since she does not speak from a position of authority other than having lived on-campus and seems more interested in implementation than theory, if she were to join the project, I would recommend her to do so as communications design or writing staff, rather than in the current preparatory phase.

Once a decision has been made regarding staffing for the project, please assign employees as such in InternalProgramNameHere and send me an email so I can grant access to the current draft materials.

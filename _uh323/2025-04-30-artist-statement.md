"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that anyone who is in a STEM-related field is horrible at art." - Jane Austin (probably)

Not everybody has the ability to string together brush strokes into a masterpiece, plaster paper mache into a sculpture, or create beauty with not but a pencil. What is true, however, is that while some people can't, there should be others who are prohibited from even trying, as their attempts at art will cause others to bleed from their eyes in agony.

Unfortunately, I am one of those people.

And yet, I make (somewhat decent) art anyways. This semester, my focus has been on one device: the printer. From my drum-leaf book with only printed stickers to my flipbook, which was entirely printed, the past five months have been an exercise in how to use digital document editing tools in ways outside of their design to construct works of art, as well as constructing new tools that transform existing digital art into new mediums.

Through this, I am able to take works of art released to the public domain and reimage them in my own style, combining works from a variety of different sources to send my own unique message. By making tools and pipelines, I am making the art of the book accessible to others like me, who, while perhaps never having moved on from stick figures, still have messages of our own to send.

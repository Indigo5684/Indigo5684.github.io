This assignment was to create three reads of the poem [Late Fragment](https://allpoetry.com/Late-Fragment) by Raymond Carver. Reading this poem, I got a sense of retrospection, of looking back of life, and as such, decided to create three reads that appeal to the topic when viewed together, rather than individually as much of the class did.

Appealing to the retrospective nature, looking back on book arts, the first book I ever made was probably an accordion. It wasn't a very good book, and I certainly don't really remember it, but I can recreate it.

This book plainly states that it is made by a 3rd-grader, for their English Language Arts course. Actually writing the poem with the command of English expected by a third-grader was difficult, as while basic grammatical errors (eg. non-capitalized Is) and minor spelling mistakes are acceptable, altering the text of the poem in a meaningful way is not. As such, I was forced to ensure any mistake I included was either cosmetic or grammatical rather than, say, rearranging or substituting difficult words.

If I were to do this again as part of a professional work, I would not have used printer paper, but instead either cardboard (not cardstock) or thin, loose-leaf notebook paper torn out of a spiral notebook. I would have also done my best to fold every-so-slightly askew, though in a way as that the overall effect would cancel out across the entire book. Lastly, I would have made more mistakes, such as misspelling the author's name as "Raymond Carter". These details were omitted from this specific work as I did not want to chance my grade on the artistic effect of intentional mistakes.

Next on the list of books is the middle-of-the-road book, or the "classic" book. This is what most people think of when they consider a book: pages and text. Like any other book, this 2ill contain a preface, author biography, testimonials on the back, and cover art. You may have noticed future tense in the previous sentence, as this is not just any book, but an advance, pre-publication copy. The text of the story has been written, but the finer details are still to be determined based on pre-release feedback.

In reality, this is a cop-out for my poor drawing and artistic skills. A notable image of this book is the full spread. I made the deliberate choice not to glue nor tape the pages in the folded state to emphasize the simplicity of this book, in that all visible text is on one side of a page. As such, a dedicated artist can design a book and print it in such a way where it comes together cleanly and easily. Such option was considered for this book, however I don't own a printer, and I judged my poor handwriting as worth the tradeoff of using a public printer and the resulting thinner printer paper.

Last on our retrospective book-arts journey is a modified flag-book, complete with board covers. This book is intended to show the most advanced techniques in book arts available to me in this assignment in the covers (though sans an inlay), as well as appear as the most 'quality' of the books in the collection, representing experience gained.

The book was originally intended as a poetry journal of sorts, with the owner's name and contact info written (blacked out in the above images), and blank pages for the author to fill in as they read or write poetry of their own. In retrospect, this was not well communicated. I based this off of a classic journal, which doesn't have a title labeling it as such as many journal-like products can be a diary, writing journal, poetry journal, spiral notebook for classes, or similar. I also didn't leave any guides on the pages for handwriting, which would have helped to convey the message. If I were to do this again, I would also have a dedicated page inside the cover stating that this is a poetry journal, as well as the owner's name and contact info.

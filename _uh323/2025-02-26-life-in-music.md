So. The original flag book as made of 5x9 images, with a pretty poem written on the flags.

Then I messed it up on Sunday. Crimson Copies, our local print shop, opens Monday. Outside of classes, I had three hours including lunch that I could have stopped by for a reprint. When I did, I managed to get 8.5x11 images instead and didn't notice, as I was in a rush. By the time 8pm rolled around and I could re-bind the book, Crimson Copies was closed, so I was forced to say "screw it" and spend the next few hours before bed making an oversized book.

It somehow didn't end too terribly.

By which I mean it ended badly, but no so bad as to make me cry. Even with doubling the margin of cutting for each flag, I still had a very oversized book. Fun fact: the art kits we were provided with do not have board tall enough for an 11" cover. Covers were made no more than an hour before class, as that was when I was able to source material. Naturally, my somewhat-thick decorative paper also happened to not fit in my backpack, so I grabbed some cardboard to use as cover paper instead. Cardboard that happened to be too small.

That left the on-hand stock of cover paper, which was thin and fragile to the point of tearing during gluing, to which my reaction was to hide the error with oversized pastedowns. Naturally, I attached the pastedowns before the book block, leaving part of the accordion visible. I will not confirm whether this was an intentional design choice to avoid applying stress to the wrapped-around flaps of the fragile cover paper, or if it was a mistake that I'm playing off as a feature.

There were also some content changes. By this, I mean I hated the poem I had originally, and when the available whitespace quadrupled in surface area, I decided that my handwriting in large fonts was somehow worse than my regular handwriting and scrapped the poem entirely. With the loose justification that songs are simply spoken poems, I made this into a musical self-portrait album, complete with QR codes to song links and fun facts about why I chose each particular song.

If I were to do this again, each QR code would point to a service such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMHJGd3wwZk), so that I could include analytics. This would allow me to track how often people scan the QR codes, and then create metrics such as scans per book purchased, as well as track which individual books see the most users scan pages. It would also allow me to redirect links as-needed, in the event of a takedown on YouTube or other issues.

Additionally, I'd like to use some blank space more. The title/author flag could potentially have album art or a thumbnail, and the covers have no title on the front to indicate which way the book opens. I'd also like to switch out the image, but as my phone tends to be wiped semi-frequently or simply break (such as in UH 223), most photos don't tend to last long on my devices, so the current image is simply what I had on-hand and doesn't really fit the theme.

Lastly, the pastedowns contain little content on this version of the book. I've moved the colophon to the back of the last flags, as there's no QR code associated with them, but I'm far too self-conscious (and not narcissistic enough) to have an intro at the front, a colophon, and an About Me page in the back. I generally ran out of ideas for how to use that space. Future editions, if I ever make them, will likely have an engraving on the interior instead.

These images were taken on the floor. The palatable rationale behind this choice is that I felt that a wite background would contrast against the back of the images, which are also white. The actual rationale is that a large book would not fit on the poster paper in-class, and I had to take images at home. It turns out the only options for a solid, matte surface were blankets, carpet, or kitchen tiles (as I don't want to tape the book to the wall for an image), and I had to choose the lesser of three evils.

All in all, this book was a disaster. An educational disaster, but still a disaster nonetheless.

At least I got to rickroll two people out of it!
